# Intern Performance Management System (PMS)

A production-quality, modular, end-to-end web platform engineered to streamline intern onboarding, objective setting, evidence-backed progress tracking, multi-phase appraisal scoring, and executive reporting.

---

## 🌟 Key Capabilities

- **🔐 Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict database- and route-level authorization across 4 distinct personas: `INTERN`, `MANAGER`, `HR`, and `SUPER_ADMIN`.
- **🎯 Dynamic Goal & KPI Tracking:** Managers assign weighted goals with quantitative KPIs; interns log progress with automatic completion updates.
- **📎 Verifiable Evidence Reviews:** Interns attach PR links, design specs, or documents; managers review, approve, or request revisions.
- **⚖️ Transparent Mathematical Scoring Engine:** Weighted evaluation combining Goal Completion (40%), Manager Criteria Assessment (40%), and Intern Self-Assessment (20%) with configurable criteria weights.
- **🔒 Privacy Gated Appraisal Lifecycles:** Appraisals transition through `DRAFT -> SUBMITTED -> UNDER_REVIEW -> HR_APPROVED -> PUBLISHED`. Interns are strictly barred from viewing manager ratings until HR officially publishes the cycle.
- **📅 Daily Attendance Tracking:** High-integrity daily attendance logging with unique `(employee, date)` constraints.
- **🎓 Training & Curriculum Tracking:** Track course completion rates, hours, and skill acquisitions.
- **📊 Executive Reports & Analytics:** SQL-aggregated dashboards for Intern Personal Performance, Team Roster Overview, and HR Bell Curve Analytics with CSV export.
- **📜 Immutable Tamper-Evident Audit Trail:** Every administrative mutation and appraisal event is logged with actor, entity ID, and metadata.
- **📖 OpenAPI 3.0 & Swagger UI:** Fully interactive schema documentation with JWT Bearer authentication.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python:** 3.11 or 3.12
- **PostgreSQL:** 16 (`brew install postgresql@16 && brew services start postgresql@16`)
- **Node.js:** 18+

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL and create database & user
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER intern_pms_user WITH PASSWORD 'intern_pms_password';"
psql postgres -c "ALTER USER intern_pms_user CREATEDB;"
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE intern_pms_db OWNER intern_pms_user;"
psql postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE intern_pms_db TO intern_pms_user;"
```

### 3. Backend Setup & Seed
```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations & seed realistic demo data

## 👥 Built-in Demo User Accounts

The database seeder (`backend/seed_intern_pms.py`) initializes realistic accounts across all personas:

| Role | Username | Email | Default Password | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SUPER_ADMIN** | `admin` | `admin@company.com` | `AdminPassword123!` | System administrator with full access to audit logs & global settings. |
| **HR** | `hr_sarah` | `sarah.hr@company.com` | `SarahPassword123!` | Head of People; manages cycles, criteria weights, and publishes appraisals. |
| **MANAGER** | `manager_marcus` | `marcus.tech@company.com` | `MarcusPassword123!` | Engineering Lead; assigns goals, reviews evidence, evaluates interns. |
| **MANAGER** | `manager_elena` | `elena.qa@company.com` | `ElenaPassword123!` | QA Lead & Mentor. |
| **INTERN** | `intern_alex` | `alex.dev@company.com` | `AlexPassword123!` | Backend intern with goals, evidence, attendance, and published appraisal. |
| **INTERN** | `intern_maya` | `maya.ux@company.com` | `MayaPassword123!` | Frontend & UI/UX intern. |
| **INTERN** | `intern_liam` | `liam.qa@company.com` | `LiamPassword123!` | QA Automation intern. |
