| BUG-SA-04 | Super Admin | Open Intern Details Modal | 🔴 High | Clicking intern card threw `ValidationError` | Frontend passed numeric/string IDs; backend queried strict UUID only | Added multi-field fallback: `id | employee_code | username` in `EmployeeCompatView` | `frontend_compat/views.py` | ✅ Fixed |

| BUG-HR-02 | HR Operations | Intern Status Toggle | 🔴 High | HTTP 405 on Activate/Deactivate | No backend route for `/emp/<pk>/activate` or `/emp/<pk>/deactivate` | Created `EmployeeStatusToggleCompatView`; added `patch` handler | `frontend_compat/views.py`, `urls.py` | ✅ Fixed |

| BUG-HR-07 | HR Operations | Goal Progress Update Validation | 🟠 Medium | HTTP 400 `"progress_percentage: This field is required"` | Serializer strictly required `progress_percentage` | Updated serializer to accept `progress` alias; default comment if omitted | `goals/serializers.py` | ✅ Fixed |
| BUG-TM-01 | Tech Manager | Manager URL Routing | 🔴 Critical | HTTP 404 on `/manager/mentees/` and all manager routes | `apps.manager.urls` only mounted under `api/manager/`; Vite lacked proxy | Mounted `manager/` in `config/urls.py`; added `/manager` proxy in `vite.config.ts` | `config/urls.py`, `vite.config.ts` | ✅ Fixed |
| BUG-TM-02 | Tech Manager | Appraisal Draft Save | 🔴 High | HTTP 405 on `POST /api/manager/appraisals/` | `ManagerAppraisalSubmissionsView` had only `def get` | Added `def post` to create/update `Appraisal` with `DRAFT` status | `manager/views/appraisal_views.py` | ✅ Fixed |
